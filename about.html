        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Claire. I was born and raised in Houston, TX but have since migrated to Memphis, TN.  I came to Memphis to attend Rhodes College. When I started I was very undecided on my major, but 4 years later and I finished with a B.S. in Chemistry.</p>
        <p>While I was at Rhodes, I ran collegiately both Cross Country as well as Track and Field.  I also took pride in being a member of RUF (Reformed University Fellowship) where I made many friends and went on some exciting mission trips over spring break.</p>
        <p>After graduation I continued to work at Start Co. where I had previously interned and was hired on as the Program Manger. In my job I worked to recruit startups, plan and deliver accelerator programming.  After a year of working with primarly IT startups, I decided to join one part-time.  I was offered a postion with Preteckt where I've worked to build out their hardware unit. From soldering, to programming, to cutting wire, I've done a little bit of everything.</p>
        <p>When I took the part-time job with Preteckt, I knew I wanted to begin transitioning into more of a developer. I signed up for Thinkful's web development course and have enjoyed learning how to build websites.</p>
